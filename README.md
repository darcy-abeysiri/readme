# About Me


Hi there! I’m a passionate technology enthusiast and aspiring full stack developer. My coding journey began at DevAcademy, where I immersed myself in web development.

I specialize in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express.js, with experience in APIs, database management, and test-driven development. I love collaborating with others and utilizing Git and GitHub to bring projects to life.

I’m eager to learn new technologies and stay updated on industry trends, believing in the power of technology to drive innovation and improve lives.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring tech news, working on personal projects, or reading a good book.
